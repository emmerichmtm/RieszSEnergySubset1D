Title: Minimizing Riesz s-Energy in Ordered Points Using Dynamic Programming
       and Brute Force

Problem Statement:
    Given a sorted list of points (in increasing order) and a parameter s > 0, the goal is
    to select a subset of k points such that the Riesz s-energy is minimized. The Riesz s-energy
    for a subset S is defined as:

        E(S) = Î£_{p < q in S} 1 / (x[q] - x[p])^s

    Two methods are implemented:
      1. A Dynamic Programming (DP) approach that builds up the optimal solution
         efficiently by considering smaller subproblems.
      2. A Brute Force approach that enumerates all possible subsets of size k to determine
         the minimum energy configuration.
         
    The code assumes that the input list of points is strictly increasing, ensuring that all
    differences (gaps) are positive.
